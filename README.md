This project focuses on building the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on any pre-built clustering libraries like scikit-learn.
The main objective is to gain a deep understanding of how K-Means works internally — from centroid initialization to convergence.

A synthetic, multi-modal dataset is used to evaluate the robustness of the implementation. The project also applies Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters and visually interpret the final clustering result.
